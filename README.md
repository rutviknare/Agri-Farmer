# Plant Growth Recommendation System based on Weather Conditions and Soil Patterns using Machine Learning and Deep Learning Techniques üåø
#### A simple ML and DL based App which recommend which plant they have to growth on the basics of weather condition.

## DISCLAIMER ‚ö†Ô∏è
The data used here comes up from varius sourses. So, use it for making farming decisions. But this project not that much of accuracy to growth particular plant based on weather condition. However, this project presents the idea that how we can use ML/DL and android concept into precision farming if developed at large scale and with authentic and verified data.

## MOTIVATION üí™
- Farming is one of the major sectors that influences a country‚Äôs economic growth. 

- In country like India, majority of the population is dependent on agriculture for their livelihood. Many new technologies, such as Machine Learning and Deep Learning, are being implemented into agriculture so that it is easier for farmers to grow and maximize their yield. 

- In this project, I present a website in which the following applications are implemented; Crop recommendation, Fertilizer recommendation and Plant disease prediction, respectively. 

    - In the crop recommendation application, the user can provide the soil data from their side and the application will predict which crop should the user grow. 
    
    - For the fertilizer recommendation application, the user can input the soil data and the type of crop they are growing, and the application will predict what the soil lacks or has excess of and will recommend improvements. 
    
    - For the last application, that is the plant disease prediction application, the user can input an image of a diseased plant leaf, and the application will predict what disease it is and will also give a little background about the disease and suggestions to cure it.

## DATA SOURCE üìä
I used my Custom code for weather prediction and soil Composition which available below the link. (https://github.com/rutviknare/weather-api-code)

## Notebooks üìì
##### I have also published the corresponding code on My Github(Below the code is specific for one district for weather).
- [Weather Prediction](https://github.com/rutviknare/weather-api-code/blob/main/kolhapur.csv)
- For Soil Composition dataset Updated Soon...
